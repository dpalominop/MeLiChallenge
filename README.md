# MeLiChallenge
Challenge proposed by Mercado Libre.

## Steps:
The suggested order to review this work is as follows:
1. data_exploration.ipynb
2. preprocessing.ipynb
3. training.ipynb
4. evaluation.ipynb

However, you can go directly to training.ipynb or evaluation.ipynb and review or execute the notebook, because results from previous notebooks are saved as independent modules.
